I recently finished Metaphor: ReFantazio (here after known as metaphor) and it took me about 3 months, on and off to get through it. I thought that since I've written about other various topics that I'd word salad my thoughts on metaphor as well, since it might better help me understand why I didn't enjoy this game compared to the other persona games. I am aware this is not an official persona title, but it played so similar to one that you might consider this persona 6. But first, maybe I'll try to explain how I was coming into the game, to give some context on my thoughts.

### Where I was when starting Metaphor<a name="start"/>
I guess to really talk about this then I'd have to try and remember where I was coming in, which was 3 months ago. Luckily, I've started writing what I do daily in a journal, so I might be able to peek at some of the things I talked about 3 months ago.

Ok I just read the journal articles I wrote for the four day span after starting metaphor. A tl;dr of my life then was that I was in interviews with a couple of companies, and looking very stressed and lost in life. 

In terms of recreation, I had stopped reading umineko because of a certain scene and character that I do not wish to divulge here. After stopping umineko, I turned to fairy fencer f dark advent force and another not good anime game that I will not name here out of shame (it is a really bad game, that I have finished previously.) I analyse this now as falling back on comfort games for hard times (particularly due to having a lot of stress looking for a job.) This might be a reason that reflects on my opinion on the game in general.

> I was not in a good mental space starting this game, definitely a lot different than, for example when I played Persona 5/Royal for the first time.

### The First Chunk of the Game<a name="first"/>
_Note: I will use social links and bonds interchangeably_

Now that I know where I was mentally (not good), I can actually start talking about the game. The game started off with the anime cutscenes and Louis killing the king, and you get that story building about a world you have no idea about. There's a lot of anime and a couple hours of introduction until you can actually play the game. I'm not really a medieval game fan myself (mostly anime game fan), so there was definitely some distinterest from the beginning.

However, when I was able to actually do the persona like part of the game where you choose what to do and get to clear dungeons, I hopped on board pretty quickly. This excitement is likely related to a level of familiarity, running through dungeons, building social links, raising stats. Different coat of paint, but essentially the same systems I'm used to in Persona. 

The first 1-2 months of the game are pretty well laid out, with a good mix of story and free time. The biggest boon from this game which I expect to maybe be implemented in persona 6 is the lowered amount of importance to choosing the right dialogue options in social links. Since you always will rank up a bond when spending time with them, this means the time limiting factor is just how well you space them out, and how well you raise your stats.

The stats raising is still a bit of a pain point though. As a GameFAQs user, I am very used to looking up guides/攻略, so I was able to learn about the hidden system behind the numbers used to calculate your social stats. If I didn't know that sitting on the bench and the first quest would give me enough wisdom to do brigitta, I probably would've unlocked her much later. I think it's stuff like this that keeps me using guides, feeling the need for optimization otherwise you will miss content (which is a common theme for the persona games.)

But I digress, the cycle of story -> 5-15 days of free time -> story -> 5-15 days of free time -> story... worked out quite well. I feel like I was never getting bored but also did not feel like I was behind on stats. Doing stats raising while traveling was a big bonus to this. Normally in persona games, going to the dungeon means you use 2 time slots, whereas regular actions take one. There is some optimization that can be done in metaphor, but for the most part going to dungeons doesn't feel as bad cause you can read a book, sharpen weapons with ryuuji (stroll), etc. Effectively, you're spending 1 time slot on the dungeon, as even if you travel 2 days you get a night timeslot on the first day.

I continued chugging through the months of the game, amassing jobs and party members. Everything was going well, up until one specific dungeon, which definitely could be infamous.
### Breaking Point: This dungeon was way too long<a name="break"/>
I am not going to explicitly spoil which dungeon this is, but if you've played the game you know which dungeon I'm talking about. This dungeon was definitely at least 1.5 dungeons worth of content, and it's about at the midpoint of the game where you actually need to think about sp regen if you're trying to clear a dungeon in one day. I try to play persona games optimally, so even if you're only wasting one time slot as you can raise stats in the car, one time slot = one time slot. 

I think there's also a matter of you should probably do this dungeon a bit after when you can do it. For every main dungeon, there's a couple of side quests/dungeons that you can check out usually even before you attempt the main dungeon. Without looking at a guide, you wouldn't assume to do one before the other, or one is easier than the others, but I ended up doing this dungeon first which made the side dungeons easier, but also it slowed down my social link building of another character which would've helped in this dungeon. 

<details>

  <summary>Spoilers: If you want more context</summary>

I make this statement because you unlock the dungeon to unlock juna's social link at the same time as starting eupha's dungeons, and having masked dancer's +3 mana a turn (potentially more) passive during the shinjuku dungeon would've helped considering the number of fights.

</details>

But regardless of the whole planning thing, I think they also did not intend that players do this dungeon in one in game day given the length and the enemy strength. The dungeon I would say is split into three sections which increase in enemy difficulty. Compound this with the fact that the save points are kind of stretched out (thank god that if fantasy is over you spawn at the last item glowy point), and one thing I'll take about later as my largest gripe of the game, but this dungeon was not fun. Extra points because I was playing healer and those attacks in the overworld are kind of miserable (wizard is more miserable but hey you had to pick one.)

This dungeon made me crash out with the game, the once fun gameplay loop just got singlehandedly destroyed by this dungeon being 7 hours long (it was for me, maybe a skill issue.) Regardless, I trudged onwards cause I knew there were only 2ish in game months left to finish the game (based off the in game calendar.)

### The "Twist", and Free Time<a name="twist"/>
I will say, once getting to the last town I was wondering how the plot would turn out. I was also surprised by the sequence of events that happens in the next like week of in game days. It's a bit of a blur now but: (apologies this is difficult to talk about without spoiler tagging.)

<details>

  <summary>Spoilers: If you want more context</summary>

Louis "dying" and coming back and the sequence of events with florian? I think his name was, then the switch to Leila and the death of Leila, very sad. I didn't care about fidelio's death but damn I thought Leila was going to be a party member after seeing her in the colliseum. But I can see people who stand on the "man i like fidelio" and don't give a shit about Leila (after all, she almost killed you.)

</details>

I will say though that this part of the game was like "oh shit" times five, but what was left at the end was a bit disappointing for me, a persona player who tries to min max and complete all social links.

I think it is fine to say that you get a lot of free time at the end of the game, I will not explicitly say how much, but there is so much free time that you would have to try your hardest not to max all of the bonds in the game. An effort must be actively made to try and not finish the bonds, that is how much free time you get. Of course, with the extra time you can finish a lot of the side content e.g. the coliseum, but I ended up sleeping many days through cause there was  just nothing left that I cared to do.

I don't think this is bad game design, especially since when you play persona, you feel like you miss out on x y or z social link because you had to eat beef bowls with ryuuji 3 extra times to max out his 10 level social link. I actually really like the "choices don't really matter" change, but it is a bit disappointing as the type of player who tries to min max these things. If I was told from the start that I didn't need a guide or to sweat, I might've (probably still would've) not used a guide for the game. 

### My Real Gripe with Metaphor<a name="gripe"/>

I think the retry system and no damage bonus at the end of combat makes it so you should never take a losing fight in metaphor. I guess this might not be that weird of a hot take, for example in persona 5 when you're surrounded, you probably shouldn't try to fight (but I think you can't escape until you kill one of the enemies?) I think these systems however amplify how bad you should not deal with bad encounters.

I guess the caveat here is that if you can't run (i.e. don't outspeed the enemy), there's nothing you can do but fight, but due to respawning at blue glowy items, I found it sometimes more useful to game over than to take a bad fight. If you think about it, taking a disadvantage encounter will likely cost a lot more mana (if you even have the enemy weakpoints in your elements), than just respawning at the closest blue thing, which there are usually a million of. And now, the rant of a lifetime:

<details>

  <summary>Spoilers: My real gripe with the long dungeon</summary>

So because this dungeon ended up being so long with many different enemy weaknesses, combined with small spaces, this dungeon was very annoying. I distinctly remember game overing 10 some times due to getting disadvantage encountered against the snakes because I couldn't run and there was no reason to play out the fight. You are literally forced to use a party of 2+ (i think i had 3) mages in order to aoe ice the snakes down, again because you want to preserve mana to do the dungeon in one day. Combine this with the fact that if you're lower level, the wizard overworld attack is miserable (yes I understand it's broken theoretically when they're blue/siginificantly lower level than you.) 

This dungeon was just hell for me cause I didn't want to play 5 mages huh.

</details>

Anyways maybe my gripes didn't get across, but the tl;dr or summary here is that it is both a skill issue and the dungeon was way too long for it's own good. Also due to the mechanics at hand, the convenience mechanics (battle restarting, better check pointsm no damage exp bonus), there was just no reason to take a losing fight, like ever. Like i'd rather run, get advantage in overworld and restart the fight.

That also just reminded me that holy shit the targeting system for squad was terrible. I usually missed the button press for entering a combat when stunning an enemy (skill issue), but if this stunned enemy is not like right in the middle of your screen and there's another enemy on the side, it will always prioritize the non stunned enemy. I realise again, skill issue, but that was the worst user experience I've had that I had issues with all game.

And one final gripe which I don't think is solvable, or maybe it's a skill issue again, end game combat was extremely boring.

<details>
  <summary>Spoilers: Endgame classes</summary>
Basilio's royal berserker level 1 skill was the most broken shit ever. You literally have 3 support bots + basilio spam this shit and he just does 4k no problem every turn ok nice balance riot games.
</details>

And then the when buffed gain 10 mana a turn was absolutely necessary for every party member. It's nice that it's accessible, but that was literally the only mana regen that I used.

### In Conclusion<a name="conclusion"/>

I mostly wrote this post to rant about my experience with the long dungeon and my gripes with the combat system, but I really did enjoy many parts of the game. I also acknowledge that I haven't been in the best head space when starting, playing, or finishing this game. I'm not 18 years old right out of high school where I'd say I didn't have the best high school experience that persona let me simulate. I'm not in my parent's home 14 years old playing on the vita being like persona 4 is so cool they have glasses and use shoes to kick the enemy etc. 

I think a large part of me not enjoying metaphor as much as I enjoyed persona games before (unlike <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17289/metaphor-refantazio" target="_blank">critics</a>) is just the stage of life that I'm in. I guess I really don't play 80 hour jrpgs that often anymore (Kiseki/trails series is the exception here, excited for the remake later this year.) 

But I'll give flowers where they're due:
- There was a lot of animated cutscenes in this game, and they were all a joy to see
- The music (mvp monk) was fantastic
- The graphics were great, a good mix of anime art + models
- ハイザメ(heimsmay?) was the goat with his deep voice
- Passing (in battle) was OP
- It was overall, a very fun game

8/10 would not play again.
