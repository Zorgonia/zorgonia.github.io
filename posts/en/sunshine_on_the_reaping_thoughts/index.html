<p><em>Note: (Major) Spoilers Ahead!</em></p>
<p>I will preface by saying that I do like to read books, but most of my reading has been done in either Japanese, or through non-fiction English books.
I usually read Japanese books, mostly light novels, to practice reading Japanese. More recently, I've been reading more non-fiction English books however, just on the train or during breakfast.
I always gave the excuse that &quot;oh, reading English fiction just makes my eyes glaze over.&quot; Reflecting on that a bit now, I think my eyes just glaze when I'm reading something really boring, so with most of my high school reading being Shakespeare, it's no wonder that I thought this way.</p>
<p>Naturally, I didn't think when I'd jump back into English fiction that I'd be reading a series that I last read in grade 8 (as of writing, 11 or so years ago.) I actually started reading this book off recommendation of a coworker. She mentioned that she was up late reading it the night before, and that it was really good. Intrigued, I decided to find a copy later that night and finished the novel within the week.</p>
<p>Sunshine on the Reaping is a Hunger Games prequel novel, about Haymitch Abernathy, who is a mentor is the original Hunger Games. It follows his journey of how he wins the games, and all  the struggles between him and the Capitol. I don't particularly tout myself as a good reader or writer, but I feel like I enjoyed my experience enough to write a couple thoughts about the book, and actually update this website for the first time in 2 months.</p>
<p>Whollistically speaking, I really enjoyed reading Sunshine on the Reaping. I remember almost nothing from the Hunger Games series, so when my coworker was trying to sell me on it I was like &quot;maybe I'll have to review what actually goes on in the trilogy.&quot;</p>
<p>However, after reading the first couple chapters, I was absolutely hooked.
Collins creates an amazingly atmospheric story that captures you into the world immediately with Haymitch describing his life in District 12, and the threat of the reaping. The book gives you some time to know the characters, and then jumps right into the drawing. The name drawing ceremony depicts the dystopian society that they live in, killing Woodbine when he makes a break for it and omitting it on the broadcast to the Capitol.</p>
<p>Even as someone who does not remember much about the Hunger Games and why the games take place, as well as why there is such a divide between the Districts and the Capitol, the depictions of the difference in power are staggering. The way that all the interactions between the tributes and the peace keepers and Capitol people (Drusilla, President Snow, Plutarch, etc.) are very entertaining.</p>
<p>Another thing I enjoyed about the novel was the character development. Maysilee, in particular, went from a seemingly stuckup brat to a very likable character in the end. Showing attitude towards the peacekeepers wasn't a bad thing, but through the eyes of Haymitch she wasn't painted in a particularly good light at first. As you get to know her over time though, she becomes a very likeable and resourceful character. With building District 9's tokens, and saving Haymitch from Panache, and also holding Lenore's secret, it pained me to see her go.</p>
<p>Speaking of deaths, I will say that some characters feel like they died very suddenly. While I do understand all the content needs to fit in 400 pages, the Chariot scene where Louella dies proceeded very quickly. I guess straight from the death in the name drawing, the reader's expectations that deaths can be sudden and painful, or maybe because they happen so frequently you get used to it. Maysilee's death hurt though, even if I, the reader, knows 47+ kids are going to die.</p>
<p>And the ending that made Haymitch's life a living hell, to tie into the original trilogy was great. I again, don't remeember much about how he is portrayed as a mentor, just being drunk. I do feel like I am missing a level of appreciation for how things turn out. Since I had such a positive experience even without the additional layer of context, I think it's safe to say the book was a great read, and I almost couldn't put it down.</p>
<p>Another part of the novel that I found fascinating was the use of giving hope and despair to Haymitch. As a famous black and white bear once said, you can never have despair without some hope (don't fact check this.) The beginning of the novel seems like such a doomed situation, but when Haymitch is not initially drawn, you have hope. Only to immediately be shattered by the running, and the killing. The hope that is shown in the training, building an alliance to outnumber the careers, to leave day one with 16 Newcomers dead and only 2 Careers dead. I truly wanted to believe Haymitch's suffering would end after winning the games, but his bread and milk filled days into the many disasters that unfolded were truly heartwrenching. The contrast between the hope and despair was well laid out, and it kept me dreading what would happen when something good happened.</p>
<p>One final thing that I'll comment on is the usage of dividers or scene breaks. I'm not sure what the proper terminology is, but in novels there are sometimes breaks in the text where the scene changes. I didn't notice any while reading, and it did actually greatly affect my reading experience. Having a continuous story felt like I, the reader, never got a break, similar to how Haymitch was thrown into his situation without reprieve (except for maybe the beginning.) There were pseudo scene breaks, with Haymitch sleeping, but even those scenes didn't detach Haymitch nor me from the situation.</p>
<p>As a summary of my thoughts about the book, it is an atmospheric, gripping read that I had trouble putting down. I got pulled into the story and was always on my toes about what was going to happen next. I had hope that some things would work out, and that there would be sunshine on the reaping, but to brought more despair than I ever expected. And with that, all I can say is:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I love you like allfire.&quot;</em></p>
